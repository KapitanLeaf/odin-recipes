    <p>
        A rich and creamy Swedish meatball sauce makes a comforting meal when served over pre-cooked meatballs. 
        This quick and easy recipe makes a generous amount of sauce for 10 ounces of frozen meatballs. Serve over egg noodles or rice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef Stock</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Meatballs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk together stock, cream, flour, soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon rosemary in a large saucepan over low heat until smooth. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in thawed meatballs, and continue cooking until meatballs are heated through, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the center of the meatballs should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
            </li>
                
            <li>
                Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.
